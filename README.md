## Why and How
I decided to make the card game Blackjack because it is my favorite card game to play and I feel like this game can be used in order to keep my programming skills up-to-par when I have down time (using data structures like a stack for the cards and algorithms for shuffling the cards, etc).  
I made this game using Python, as it is a language that I feel comfortable using. I used *insert libraries here*.

## Rules of the Game
This is a version of the popular card game Blackjack, where a player is dealt 2 cards at the start of the game and a dealer is also dealt 2 cards. If the dealer has 21 points, then that is known as a "Blackjack" and the player loses their bet. Otherwise, the player can choose to hit, stand, double down (they can put down their initial bet and be dealt one more card) or split (where the player doubles their bet and then plays with 2 hands, however this can only be done if the player is dealt 2 cards of the same value).
